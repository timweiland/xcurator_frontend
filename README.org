** Requirements
- [[https://nodejs.org/en/][Node.js]] v14+
 
** Development
- Run =npm i= in the root directory to install all packages
- Make sure =.env.development= fits your needs - if it doesn't, create a copy called =.env.development.local= and change any values as you see fit
- Run =npm run dev= to start the next.js development server
  + It supports hot reloading - no need to restart the development server for code changes
    - You will need to restart it e.g. for changes to the .env though
- Please use a code formatter before committing.
  + I run [[https://prettier.io/][Prettier]] automatically on each save
  + TODO: We should add a pre-commit hook for this at some point
